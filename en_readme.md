# Welcome!
**YourTelebot** is a free and open-source program that allows you to create a Telegram bot capable of:
- Searching and working with files
- Taking screenshots and webcam photos
- Interacting with the mouse and keyboard
- *And much more...*

! Always remember that people with access to the accounts you specify can do anything with your PC. Stay safe!

# Installation
### 1. Install YourTelebot
> Choose the latest release, download it, and extract the archive to any convenient location.

### 2. Download Python (if not installed)
> Go to the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and install one of the latest versions.
> 
> Important: During installation, enable "Add Python to PATH." This is necessary for the program to automatically install the libraries required for stable operation.
> 
> Recommended version developed for YourTelebot: 3.12.7

### 3. Fonts
> Open the "data" folder and install all fonts (.ttf, .otf files).
> 
> For Windows:
> Settings → Personalization → Fonts, then drag the font files into the designated window.
>
> ! This step is important because ignoring it may lead to incorrect application display.

### 4. Obtaining a Token
> Go to BotFather (the official Telegram bot where the token is created).
> 
> Use the command /newbot. Enter a name and username of your choice (we recommend using random letter combinations, e.g., neflolcsawbot).
> 
> You will receive an API token (HTTP API), which must be inserted into the corresponding element in the program.
> 
> Example token: 1234567890:ABCDEFGHIJKLmlrgUQw4fnb1mDEoA0-iZQp
